# budget tracker
I have created a progressive web app that will track the end-users budget and it will also work offline. When the customer if offline it will cache all the data into the browers and once the web app finally connects to a network it will automatically update the database.

# Installation
You will need to "npm install" to get all the npm packages and dependencies
